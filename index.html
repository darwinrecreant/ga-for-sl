        <h3>About</h3>

        <p>One of the difficulties professionals in Second Life have to deal with is the lack of feedback for their 
        products. Currently, if you wanted to analyze how your product is used, what are the most liked/used features, 
        or how engaging is your in-world store, you had to either make your own analytics storage and processing 
        implementation, which is very costly, or rely on sub-par analytics services with limited features, or simply 
        had to rely on anectdotal feedback from customers.</p>
        
        <p>Google Analytics is the defacto standard analytics service for the web. It has an endless list of features, 
        is very flexible, and did I mention free! <span class="product-name">Google Analytics for Second Life</span> is a 
        Second Life connector between Google Analytics and in-world objects. By opening a google analytics account and 
        using this product it is possible to track analytics for your sales, products, parcels, vendors, games, and just about 
        anything you can imagine that is scripted.</p>
        
        <h3>Who is this for</h3>
        
        <p>This product is geared towards sim/land owners and merchants. It provides an api for scripters to implement 
        analytics in the product they are working on. There are even several general usecase sample scripts in the 
        <span class="code">Script Examples</span> tab above that will work by simply placing into your land or vendor as 
        is.</p>
        
        <h3>What is possible with Google Analytics</h3>

        <p>Google Analytics can track things like:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Overall traffic to your sim or parcel with segmentable graphs</li>
          <li>Duration of visits to to your parcel</li>
          <li>Repeat visits and bounce rate</li>
          <li>The most popular flows of visitors from parcel to parcel or room to room</li>
          <li>Track revenue per store/vendor/product</li>
          <li>Set conversion goals and alerts</li>
          <li>Track promotions and their hit rates to your parcel</li>
          <!--<li>Frequency and duration of use of your products</li>-->
          <!--<li>The most pressed buttons on a HUD, or most used screens</li>-->
          <!--<li>Marketplace purchases</li>-->
        </ul>
    
        <h3>Privacy</h3>
        
        <p><span class="product-name">Google Analytics for Second Life</span> is a limited version of the web product, 
        and therefore does not use cookies, has no access to visitor ip's, or any of the other features of the SL viewer. 
        Out of the box, this product cannot track user data, other than simple counters for interactions within the sim. 
        Storing user identifiying data, such as name or uuid, is up to the scripter's discretion, but is against 
        Google Analytics' policies, as well as some European laws. The makers of <span class="product-name">Google Analytics 
        for Second Life</span> are not responsible for the misuse of Google and Second Life products.</p>

          <h2>GA for Sims / Parcels</h2>
          
          <p><span class="product-name">Google Analytics for Sims</span> allows sim owners to track visitors all across 
            their sim, for the duration of their stay. <span class="product-name">Google Analytics for Parcels</span> is 
            identical to the sim product in every way, with the exception that the sim version can handle up to 280 events
            per minute (your mileage may vary based on sim performance), whereas the parcel version can handle up to 20
            events per minute.</p>

          <p>The package comes with the following contents:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>GA Server (object)</strong> - The server object that handles all the tracking within the sim.</li>
            <li><strong>GA Relay (script)</strong> - The <span class="code">GA Server</span> communicates with 
              <span class="code">GA Relays</span> that act as connectors between local scripts inside objects and the 
              server.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>The procedure to setup analytics tracking within the sim is as follows:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Rez the <span class="code">GA Server</span> somewhere discrete within the sim.</li>
            <li>Select the <span class="code">Create New</span> option after clicking the server.</li>
            <li>Supply the <a href="https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/1008080?hl=en" target="_blank">UA code 
              provided by google analytics</a>, and give a label to this server. You can also decide if 
              to set tracker access to <span class="code">Group</span> or <span class="code">Owner</span> 
              (this applies to sending hit events; only owner has access to server menus). Setting to 
              group will let your tenants or other team members use the relays to send hit events to the 
              server, which will be useful if you are hosting an event, for example.
            </li>
            <li>
              Insert the <span class="code">GA Relay</span> script in the scripted objects you would 
              like to track, and link this relay to your <span class="code">GA Server</span> by 
              following the dialog popup instructions. A good place to start is with the greeter on your
              land, if you have one, to start tracking visits. There are some sample scripts you can use 
              for this in the <span class="code">Script Examples</span> tab above.
            </li>
            <li>
              If you or a colleague are up to the task, you can start tracking certain actions and events
              by using the open source scripts available in the <span class="code">Script Examples</span> 
              tab above, and script your own solutions for google analytics.
            </li>
          </ol>

          <p><strong>Important note:</strong> Once the server is rezzed and initialized, it would be a good
          idea to take a backup. If the server is deleted after you set up your relays, all relays will no 
          longer work, and all the the relays will have to be set again one by one manually if you dont have 
          a backup.</p>

          <p> When rezzing a backup, all relays will be updated automatically, and the previous 
            <span class="code">GA Server</span> will reset.</p>
          
          <p>When rezzing a fresh <span class="code">GA Server</span>, such as during an upgrade with a newer
            version, you can choose the <span class="code">Replace</span> option, to transfer the old server 
            to this fresh one. All relays will link up automatically after you are done.</p>
